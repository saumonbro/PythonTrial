# PythonTrial

## Goal

The goal of this repo is to offer a simple introduction to programming using python.

## Usage - Without testsuite

To start your adventure, simply open the file __Core.py__ using the editor of your choice (VSCode with the Python extension is a good starter choice).
A simple serie of asserts were given in the file to help your check the validity of what you have written.


## Usage - With the testsuite

A testsuite is included in the __main.py__ file. Running this file will run a set of test over your code.
